# Parts of Roots

Roots are very important parts of a plant. They help the plant stay strong and get water and food from the soil. Here are the main parts of roots:

1. **Root Tip**  
   - The end of the root that helps the root grow longer.

2. **Root Hairs**  
   - Tiny hair-like parts that take water and nutrients from the soil.

3. **Main Root**  
   - The big root that grows straight down into the soil.

4. **Branch Roots**  
   - Smaller roots that grow out from the main root to spread in the soil.

Roots are like straws for plants. They drink water and keep the plant healthy!
