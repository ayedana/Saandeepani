## Symmetry

Symmetry is when something looks the same on both sides. Imagine folding a paper in half, and both sides match perfectly. Examples are a butterfly, a star, or a leaf!

## Care

Care is when you are kind and helpful. You can care for your family, friends, or even animals. For example, feeding a pet or helping your parents shows care!

## Music

Music is made of sounds that we enjoy listening to. It can be a song, a tune from an instrument, or even the sound of birds singing. Music makes us feel happy and relaxed!

## Deplete

Deplete means to use something until it is almost finished. For example, if you keep using crayons without sharpening them, they will deplete. We should use things carefully so they donâ€™t run out!

## Carry

Carry means to pick something up and take it somewhere. For example, you carry your books to class or carry a basket of fruits. It helps us move things easily!

## Knife

A knife is a tool that helps us cut things like food or paper. It has a sharp edge, so we should always use it carefully and with an adult's help!

## Relationship

Relationship means how two people, friends, or family connect and care for each other. It is built on love, trust, respect, and kindness. Good relationships make us happy and safe. Bad ones may bring hurt. Like plants need water, relationships need time, talk, and care to grow strong.

## Sedimentation

Sedimentation means when tiny particles like sand, mud, or dirt slowly settle down at the bottom of water. For example, if you mix soil in water and leave it still, after some time the heavy soil goes down and clear water stays on top. This process is called sedimentation.
