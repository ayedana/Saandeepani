## Tangram

Tangram is a Chinese puzzle with 7 pieces â€“ 5 triangles, 1 square, and 1 parallelogram. You can join these pieces to make many shapes like animals, boats, or houses. The rule is: use all 7 pieces without overlapping. It makes learning shapes fun and grows your thinking power.

## square

A square is a shape with 4 equal sides and 4 corners. All sides are the same length, and each corner is a right angle (90Â°). It looks like a box or a dice face. Example: a chessboard box or a carrom board coin shape is a square.

## Biomass

Biomass is energy we get from plants and animals. Things like wood, dry leaves, or cow dung can be burned to make heat. Because plants grow again, biomass is a natural, renewable energy. Example: cooking with firewood is using biomass.

## Hour

An hour means 60 minutes. We use it to tell time.
Example: If a class starts at 10 oâ€™clock and ends at 11 oâ€™clock, it is 1 hour long.
ðŸ‘‰ 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds.

## Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is how green plants make their food. ðŸŒ±
Plants take sunlight, water, and air (carbon dioxide). With the help of green color in leaves (chlorophyll), they change these into food (glucose) and give out oxygen.
ðŸ‘‰ Simple: Plants use sunlight to cook their own food and help us breathe.

## Energy

Energy is the power that makes things move or work. âš¡

Example: We use food for energy to run and play. Cars use petrol for energy to move. Bulbs need electrical energy to glow.

ðŸ‘‰ Without energy, nothing can happen.
