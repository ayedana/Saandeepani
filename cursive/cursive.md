Writing in cursive is fun and looks beautiful! Here are easy steps to help you write a cursive letter:

1. **Start with a clean page:** Use a notebook with lines. This helps you keep your letters neat.
2. **Hold your pencil properly:** Use three fingers to hold your pencil. Don’t press too hard.
3. **Begin with a small curve:** Most cursive letters start with a small curve or loop. Practice making smooth curves.
4. **Connect the letters:** In cursive, each letter joins with the next one. Try to make your letters touch each other.
5. **Follow the pattern:** Look at examples of cursive letters. Copy them slowly. Start with easy letters like ‘a’, ‘c’, and ‘e’.
6. **Practice every day:** The more you practice, the better your writing will be!
7. **Don’t rush:** Write slowly and carefully. Neatness is more important than speed.
8. **Check your work:** After writing, look at your letters. Are they joined? Are they neat? Try to improve each time.
